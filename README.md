# Splendi

It is a shopping tracker that tracks your online shopping and preferences in and compiles what you have bought online, seen online to this app as it can recommend you items on the explore page.

# Design Process

An orange design was selected at first as it is related to how online shopping brands use bright and passionate colours to awaken people&#39;s spending spree, but on this app we want people to be calm and reassured that their money and shopping purchases are in good hands, thus the blue colour.

As a user I would like dark mode thus I added dark mode for my application.

# Features

The first feature would be the the form where you enter what you have bought and will be able to view them on the home page itself. The second feature displays a variety of recommendation the user might like. The last feature is settings where the user can adjust their display preferences there.

# Technologies Used

JQuery, Javascript, css, Ionic framework used to carry out user interaction

# Testing

Form for spendings. You can try entering nothing or have a missing input first to see the validation that states you have a missing field, then you can key in none numerical number for the money amount to show that the only numbers can be validated in this form. Lastly a sample spending data and continue adding to see how they add up.
